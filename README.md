MathMania is a interactive application for both teachers and students. Students will have the options to sign into the application, and based on the level they are currently on (which is decided by the teacher) they will be able to play with an interactive block, teaching them the fundamentals of fractions and how to multiply and divide fractions.

## Motivation

Fractions are hard as sh*t. We can all attest to how difficult fractions are, and in early development they are are a building block to not only advanced math courses, but basic knowledge for everyday life that everyone needs to understand. We want to build an application that makes fractions interactive, visual and easier to understand for students at multiple levels.

## How to Play

Teachers provide a teacher code to their students.  Once the student registers the game can begin !! ![Recordit GIF] (http://recordit.co/3lEn9DmXaK.gif).  

The Teachers will be able to set a student’s fraction level (beginning, intermediate and advanced) and track the students' progress.
