# MathMania

MathMania is a interactive application for both teachers and students. Students will have the options to sign into the application, and based on the level they are currently on (which is decided by the teacher) they will be able to play with an interactive block, teaching them the fundamentals of fractions and how to multiply and divide fractions.

## Motivation

Fractions are hard as sh*t. We can all attest to how difficult fractions are, and in early development they are are a building block to not only advanced math courses, but basic knowledge for everyday life that everyone needs to understand. We want to build an application that makes fractions interactive, visual and easier to understand for students at multiple levels.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## How to Play

Teachers provide a teacher code to their students.  Once the student signs in and plays the game the teacher is able to track there progress.  The Teachers will be able to set a student’s fraction level (beginning, intermediate and advanced)

Students have the option to “Explore Fractions” and just play with the interactive block, or they can be given word problems

Divide the questions into different categories (word problems and regular questions)

Questions they are getting, is dependent on what level they are on

User can break the block and begin to play with the fractions- they can do whatever they want

If a students gets too far down the rabbit hole- they will be able to click a restart button which will reset the application 

If a student gets stuck and needs help, they will have the option to ask for help, which will trigger a modal for help (***this might be an add on)
